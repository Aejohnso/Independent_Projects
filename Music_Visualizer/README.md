# Homemade Music Visualizer

This repository hosts all files related to my development of music visualizers, inspired by [this](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/14_DeepDream.ipynb) code.

## Progress

I have created a code that does the following steps:
1) Imports a song and creates a spectogram of the song using pylab. This fourier transform gives us the intensity of each frequency at each timestep in the song.
2) The spectogram is analyzed to find the volume of the song between the frequency range 0-120Hz. This range corresponds to the kick drum.
3) 

Beta version of the code coming soon.
